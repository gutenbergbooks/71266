Several independent printing presses were established
in England before the close of the fifteenth century;
and from them issued numerous books which are
invaluable to all students of antiquity from the light
they throw upon the social habits and literary
progress of our nation. Of these it may safely be said that not one
exceeds in interest that work of an unknown typographer, which is
here presented in facsimile, and which, from the town in which it
was compiled, as well as printed, is known to all bibliographers as
“The Book of St. Albans.” This work has always been a favourite,
partly because our feelings are appealed to in favour of the writer
who for centuries has taken rank as England’s earliest poetess, and
is still, in all our Biographical Dictionaries, reckoned among “noble
authors;” and partly because we love mysteries, and a mystery has
always enshrouded the nameless printer. The subjects, too, so
curiously alliterative—Hawking, Hunting, and Heraldry, have an
enticing and antique flavour about them, being just those with
which, at that period, every man claiming to be “gentle” was
expected to be familiar; while ignorance of their laws and language
was to confess himself a “churl.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>As to the language and orthography of the book, it is a never-failing
source of interest, being quite different from any other
printed work of the fifteenth century, except the St. Albans’
Chronicle from the same press. Among bibliographers it ranks as
“<i>rarissimus</i>,” the known copies being so few that they might probably
be counted on the fingers of one hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking at the book, then, all round, it will be a convenient
plan to consider these subjects separately, and to treat the volume
in its four aspects of Authorship, Typography and Bibliography,
Subject-matter, and Philology.</p>

Historians and Biographers, together with Librarians
and Booksellers, have a natural antipathy to
anonymous books; and, wherever they can, are willing
to accept the smallest amount of evidence as proof
of paternity. It saves much trouble and avoids
numerous errors in cataloguing, when a recognised name can be
associated with an anonymous work. From this tendency a bad habit
has arisen of attributing to particular writers books concerning which
the evidence of authorship is doubtful, if not altogether untrustworthy.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this very book we have a striking instance of such erroneous
attribution. The three treatises, of which the book is made up, are
quite distinct, and to a portion only of one of these is there any
author’s name attached. Yet that name, “Dam Julyans Barnes,”
altered by degrees to “Dame Juliana Berners,” is now universally
received as the name of the authoress of the whole volume. With
even less show of reason she is credited with the authorship of
a “Treatise on Fishing” for which there is not the shadow of evidence,
that treatise having been added ten years later by Wynken de Worde,
who, when reprinting the Book of St. Albans, thought that the subject
of Fishing would complete the work as a Gentleman’s Vade Mecum.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are really four distinct tractates in the Book of St. Albans,
although the two last being on Heraldry are generally counted as one.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The first is on Hawking; to this no name of the author is
attached, but it has a prologue which no one acquainted with the
other writings of the printer can doubt to be his. Of this we shall
have more to say anon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second tractate is on Hunting: it is specially associated
with the name of Dame Juliana Berners, and will require a more
extended elucidation than the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here the evidence of authorship is as good as for most pieces
of fifteenth-century production—a period at which literary rights
did not exist, and when the scribe, if at all acquainted with the
subject upon which the book he was copying treated, did not scruple
to interpolate his own ideas, and that without any egotistical vanity,
but merely from a feeling that all books being written for the good
of men, and not from vanity in the author, it was a duty to
improve them where possible. But as improvement mostly meant
the addition of something on the same subject taken from another
manuscript, we have the constant occurrence of one MS. being a
compilation of two or three others, and yet appearing under the
name of the last compiler.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this treatise on Hunting we have the express statement at
the end of the twenty-fourth page—“Explicit Dam Julyans Barnes.”
This might certainly apply to the transcription only, but, when taken
with Wynken de Worde’s version, the probability is, that the lady
compiled as well as wrote it. In the reprint by Wynken de Worde,
only ten years later than the original, he varies the colophon thus:—“¶
Explicit dame Julyans Bernes doctryne in her boke of huntynge,”
the whole reprint ending “Enprynted at westmestre by Wynkyn the
Worde the yere of thyncarnacōn of our lorde. M&#160;. CCCC&#160;. lxxxxvj.”
So that he, a contemporary, evidently believed her to be the authoress.
Later authorities attributed the whole book to her pen, but as
they were in possession of no more evidence than we now are, and
probably not so much, we should attach no weight to such statements,
which were founded simply on a vivid imagination.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>But what is known of the lady who is admitted to have compiled
the twenty-four pages on Hunting? Who was Dame Julians
Barnes? Here, unless a sentimental and inventive sympathy be
employed to throw an artificial light upon the darkness, we are in
total ignorance. A biography of her has certainly been written,
and all our Dictionaries and Encyclopædias devote a page or two
to her history, which, in 1810, under Haslewood’s nurture, attained
its full development. Even so far back as 1549, or nearly a
century after her supposed death, the learned Bale, who wrote
an account of all our English celebrities, allows his gallantry to
bedeck her memory with garments fine. “Fœmina illustris!” he
exclaims, “corporis et animi dotibus abundans ac forma elegantia
spectabilis” (An illustrious lady! abundantly gifted, both in body
and mind, and charming in the elegance of her mien). Considering
that the name of the lady is the whole of the text upon which
Bale had to build, this is by no means a bad specimen of imaginative
biography, and became a good foundation for future commentators.
The story, however, fared rather badly at first; for Holinshed,
in 1577, while echoing Bale very exactly, is made, by a curious
error of the printer, who mistook the letters <i>rn</i> for <i>m</i>, to call the
authoress Julyan Be<i>m</i>es; while Baker in his Chronicles, too careless
even to refer to the original text, adds another blunder to the
story, and, thinking that Julyan must be a man’s name, dubs the
authoress “a gentleman of excellent gifts, who wrote certain treatises
of Hawking and Hunting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Chauncy, in 1700 (History of Hertfordshire), restored her sex
to the lady, and then set to work upon making a family history
for her. His first discovery was that, being a “Dame,” she was of
noble blood. Finding also that the family name of Lord Berners
was, in olden time, spelt occasionally Barnes, he soon supplied a
father for our authoress, in the person of Sir James Berners. And
so the game of making history went on merrily up to the time of
Joseph Haslewood, who, in 1810, reprinted Wynken de Worde’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>edition of the Book of St. Albans, and supplied a full-blown
biography of the authoress, giving particulars of her birth and
education, the occupations of her youthful days, and a most imposing
pedigree. Let us quote Haslewood’s own words: “Julyans, or
Juliana, Barnes, otherwise Berners, who has been generally designated
as the authoress of the present volume, is supposed to have been
born, towards the latter end of the fourteenth century, at Roding-Berners,
in the county of Essex. The received report is that she
was the daughter of Sir James Berners, whose son was created
Baron Berners, temp. Henry IV., and that she once held the
situation of Prioress of Sopwell Nunnery, in Hertfordshire.” He
then attributes to her the authorship of all four works in the Book
of St. Albans. The difficulty of accounting for a lady so placed
writing upon such subjects, is cleverly, if not satisfactorily settled
by assuming that she passed her teens at court, partaking of the
amusements of the field, and writing for her own use a commonplace
book on various subjects. Then retiring through disappointment
(doubtless a love affair) to a cloister, her rank raised her to
the position of prioress. There in her seclusion, writing amidst the
solitude of listless hours and vain regrets, she versified the general
rules of sport from her own pleasant recollection, and from the
diaries of her youthful happiness, which fortunately she had preserved.
If we remember the mania which seized all classes for diary-keeping
at the beginning of this century, when Haslewood wrote this, it will
deepen our sense of humour to note that he attributes private diary-keeping
to a young lady who lived <i>ante</i> 1450.</p>

<p class='c008'>But enough of such sham biography; let us return to facts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The word “Dame” did not in the fifteenth century, as it does
now, imply any connection with a titled family, it meant simply
Mistress or Mrs. Chaucer speaks of Dame Partlet in this sense;
and had the Dame Julyans Barnes of the fifteenth century lived
now, she would have been just “Mrs. Barnes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Similarity of name in history, like similarity of sound in philology
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>is a will-o’-the-wisp which has led many a writer into a bog.
Allowing that Lord Berners’ name was sometimes spelt Barnes,
is that sufficient reason for making our authoress a member of
his family? I think not.</p>

<p class='c008'>That the greater portion of the book on Hunting was compiled
by Mistress Barnes, is probably correct,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and had she written
much more, and produced even an original work on the subject,
she would not have stood alone, even at that early period, as an
authoress. Crystine de Pisan, two of whose works were printed
by Caxton, was contemporary with Julians Barnes, and left not
only numerous original writings behind her—one of which was
upon the Art of War—but left her mark, and that no mean nor
ignoble one, upon the political course and moral development of
her countrymen. But Dame Julyans’ work upon Hunting is certainly
not original, as indeed very few works upon any subject were at
that period. This is evident from a glance at the text and the
grouping of the subjects. It begins with distinguishing the varieties
of beasts and their ages; the proper names by which to designate the
beasts, singly and together; on hunting and dressing a Roe, a Boar,
a Hare; of flaying; of the horns of a Roebuck; of the Hart; of the
seasons; of the Hare. Then follows, from another source, an interpolation
of a discourse between a Master of the Hunt and his man,
going over portions of the same ground again; and this ended, we
get back again to the original MS. and the dismemberment of various
beasts. All through, with the exception of the interpolated conversation,
the text is addressed to “My deare childe.” Thus we read—“Do
so, my child;” “Think what I say, my son;” “My lief
childer;” “Say, child, where you go? my dame taught you so.”
Evidently that portion was originally written for a mother to use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>as a school-book, by which her son would learn to read, and, at
the same time, become familiar with the terms of venery.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Taking Berners and Barnes to be the same word, it is curious to note—in connection
with the work attributed to Dame Juliana, viz., The Book of Hunting—that the masters
of that sport employed men called <i>Berners</i>, to be ready with relays of horses and to feed
the hounds.—<i>See</i> Halliwell’s “Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the Bodleian Library is a small manuscript on the Terms
of the Chase, the beginning of which is:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mi dere sones, where ye fare, be frith or by fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Take good hede in his tyme how Tristram wol tell.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This manuscript was probably copied by some youth as a school-exercise,
which would account for the following odd colophon—“Explicit,
expliceat, ludere scriptor eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Compare the above with the opening stanza of the verses we
attribute to Mistress Barnes:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Wheresoever ye fare, by frith or by fell,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>My dear child, take heed how Tristram doth you tell.”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. “By frith or by fell” = by forest or by plain; but see Halliwell’s Dictionary.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Sir Tristram, the well-known knight of the Round Table, was a mighty hunter, and
the great authority upon all subjects connected with the chase. Popular belief attributed
to him the origin of all the special terms used in hunting, and his name was invoked to give
authority to any statement upon this subject, just as in a later century the arithmetical rules
of Cocker give rise to the popular phrase—“According to Cocker.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The rest of the Oxford MS. is in similar accord with the print,
but nowhere in it is there a word about Mistress Barnes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The words “Explicit Dam Julyans Barnes” have been considered
to prove that the lady was alive when the book was printed. If,
however, Sir James Berners were her father, of which there is no
evidence, she must have been close upon a hundred years old
in 1486, as he died in 1390. But this is importing a needless
difficulty into the theory, which is not rendered more probable
by making the authoress and printer contemporary.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may here be as well to say a few words about Sopwell
Nunnery, over which, without a particle of evidence, our authoress
is supposed to have presided. Sopwell Nunnery, Hertfordshire,
was founded about 1140, under the rule of St. Benedict, and
subject to the Abbot of St. Albans, from which it was not far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>distant. The rule of life among the inmates was very severe, and
at the first the nuns were enclosed under locks and bolts, made
additionally sure by the seal, on the door, of the Abbot for the
time being (Chauncy’s History, p. 466). How long this lasted,
and how the nuns liked it, history saith not; but, in 1338, a
re-organisation had become imperative, and the Abbot of St.
Albans, among other instructions, ordered that no nun should lodge
out of the house, and no guest within it (Newcome, p. 468).
There does not seem much scope left here for the Prioress to
take an active part in field sports, though a hundred and fifty years
later, which was about the period of our “Dame,” many relaxations
of the strict rules may have become common. But, then, we have
apparently accurate lists of all the Prioresses of Sopwell in the
fifteenth century, and the name of Juliana Barnes does not appear
at all in them. The known dates are these:—In 1416, Matilda de
Flamstede was Prioress. Four years before her death, which was in
1430, she was succeeded by Letitia Wyttenham. The next whose
name is known was Joan Chapell; the date of her appointment is
not recorded, but as she was set aside in 1480 on account of her
age, she had probably occupied the position for many years. In
1480, Elizabeth Webb succeeded Joan Chapell.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is really known of the Dame is almost nothing, and may
be summed up in the following few words. She probably lived at
the beginning of the fifteenth century, and she possibly compiled from
existing MSS. some rhymes on Hunting.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is still the authorship of the other parts of the book to
determine, and if similarity of wording and phraseology may be taken
as evidence, they were all from one pen.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the end of the book on Heraldry the printer has put the
following—“Here endeth the book of Blasing of Arms translated and
compiled together at Seynt Albons.” Here we have the printer’s
own statement as to the origin of his text, and doubtless this, as well
as the treatise on Hawking, were made up or “compiled” from more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>than one manuscript in French. Haslewood gives a list of such as are
in the British Museum, in several of which portions of the printed
work are contained. Works on Hunting and Hawking were not
uncommon in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and are still found
in all large collections of manuscripts. There were several in the
libraries of the Dukes of Burgundy in the fifteenth century, and many
are still extant in the national collections of England and France.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other tractates in the volume have an origin very similar
to that of the Book of Hunting. The Book of Hawking is an evident
compilation from several manuscripts, which accounts perhaps for its
deficiency in arrangement and want of continuity. The Book of Coat
Armour also has two distinct sources in contemporary works, one of
which was the “De Officio Militari” of Nicholas Upton. From this
the schoolmaster copied Book IV. almost word for word, supplementing
it from “The Book of the Lineage of Coat Armour,” as
stated already. The only other literary work which can be attributed
to our printer is the extensive compilation known as the St. Albans’
Chronicle or the Fructus Temporum. But neither in the Chronicle,
where he simply combined two histories into one, nor in the Book of
St. Albans, which is also a compilation, does the schoolmaster show
any literary ability above the average of scholars of his period.</p>

<p class='c008'>As specimens of the schoolmaster’s powers of composition we
annex the following, the originals of which can be seen in the ensuing
facsimile pages:—</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='blackletter'>Prologue to the Book of Hawking.</span></h3>

<p class='c014'>“In so much that gentlemen and honest persons have great delight
in Hawking, and desire to have the manner to take hawks: and also
how and in what wise they should guide them ordinately: and to
know the gentle terms in communing of their hawks: and to understand
their sicknesses and infirmities, and to know medicines for them
according, and the many notable terms that be used in hawking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>both of their hawks and of the fowls that their hawks shall slay.
Therefore this book following in a due form shows very knowledge
of such pleasure to gentlemen and persons disposed to see it.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='blackletter'>Prologue to Mistress Barnes’ Compilation on Hunting.</span></h3>

<p class='c014'>“Likewise, as in the Book of Hawking aforesaid are written and
noted the terms of pleasure belonging to gentlemen having delight
therein, in the same manner this book following showeth to such gentle
persons the manner of Hunting for all manner of beasts, whether they
be beasts of Venery, or of Chace, or Rascal. And also it showeth all
the terms convenient as well to the hounds as to the beasts aforesaid.
And in certain there be many diverse of them as it is declared in the
book following.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='blackletter'>Prologue to the Book of Coat Armour.</span></h3>

<p class='c014'>“Here in this book following is determined the lineage of Coat
Armours: and how gentlemen shall be known from ungentle men, and
how bondage began first in angel and after succeeded in man kind,
as it is here showed in process, both in the childer of Adam and also
of Noe, and how Noe divided the world in three parts to his three
sons. Also there be showed the nine colours in Arms figured by the
nine orders of Angels, and it is showed by the foresaid colours which
be worthy and which be royal; and of regalities which be noble and
which be excellent. And there be here the vertues of Chivalry, and
many other notable and famous things, to the pleasure of noble persons
shall be showed, as the works following witnesses, whosoever liketh to
see them and read them, which were too long now to rehearse. And
after these notable things aforesaid followeth the Blasing of all manner
Arms in Latin, French, and English.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So wrote the schoolmaster. Let us now see what kind of book
this is typographically.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>

Old books must be loved, and their idiosyncrasies carefully
studied, before they will yield up <i>all</i> their treasures;
that done, the observant lover will obtain possession
of both soul and body; he may revel in the intellectual
feast provided by the author, or he may study the
material and mechanical features of the books as represented by the
peculiarities of paper and the habits and customs of the various
printers. Then, by grouping these as a botanist does his flowers,
according to their organisation into classes, orders, genera, and species,
he may extract from his volumes true replies to questions which
otherwise would remain hidden for ever. So true is the dictum, “The
Mind it is which sees, and not the Eye alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Many bibliophiles, however, of education and taste have been
positively blind when outside the circle of their own particular studies.
So it was with the Rev. Dr. M‘Neille, a well-known critic and book-collector
of sixty years ago. When addressing Dr. Dibdin he wrote thus
of “The Book of St. Albans”—“This book is itself useless, and only
a <i>bon morceau</i> for the quizzical collector.” With such feelings
towards one of the most curious works which this country produced
during the infancy of the printing press, it was simply impossible that
the interest of its pages should be revealed to him; and however rich
in divinity and <i>editiones principes</i> of the classics the library of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>worthy doctor may have been, it is evident that our Book of St.
Albans could never have been aught but an alien on <i>his</i> book-shelves.</p>

<p class='c008'>The works printed by William Caxton were almost without
exception in the English tongue, while the contemporary presses of
Oxford, St. Albans, and Machlinia were nearly all in Latin. Of the
eight books at present known to have been printed at St. Albans, the
only two in English were the “Fructus Temporum” and the work
under review. The “Fructus” or St. Albans’ Chronicle is the same
as that printed two years previously by Caxton, with the addition of
certain ecclesiastical events and Papal chronology, probably added by
the printer himself to please the monks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Book of St. Albans’ and the St. Albans’ Chronicle make a
class of themselves; but as it is impossible to understand their position
without a glance at the other works from the same press, we will give
a tabulated description of the whole eight.</p>

<p class='c008'>But who was the printer? What was his name? Was he associated
with the great Abbey? and is there any internal or external evidence in
his works to connect him with any other printer or any other town?</p>

<p class='c008'>The only notice we have of the printer is an accidental one by
Wynken de Worde, who, in reprinting the St. Albans’ Chronicle, says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>in the colophon, “Here endith this present Chronicle&#160;... compiled
in a book and also enprinted by our sometime Schoolmaster of St.
Alban.” He was a schoolmaster, then, and this will account for the
nature of his early works, all scholastic and all in Latin. Not till the
end of his typographical career did he realise the fact that the printing press,
instead of being the hobby of a few learned men, was the
educator of the people, the whole nation; and then he gave his countrymen
what they wanted—a history of their own country and a book
upon the whole (secular) duty of the gentleman, as then understood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The name of the schoolmaster-printer is quite unknown. No
notice of him is found in the records of the Abbey, nor does he
appear in any contemporary document. Yet here, as in Mistress
Barnes’s case, imagination has come to the rescue and a legendary
name has been provided.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finding that the Prologue to the Book of Hawking began with
the words, “<i>Insomuch</i> as gentle men and honest persons have great
delight in Hawking;” finding also that the St. Alban’s Chronicle
from the same press began thus: “<i>Insomuch</i> as it is necessary;”
and bearing in mind that certain old authors had veiled <i>their</i> names
in the first words of their works, Dr. Chauncy arrived at the sagacious
conclusion that the St. Albans printer wished to veil <i>his</i> name, which
really was “Insomuch.” The joke, for it almost seems like one, does
not bear even the scrutiny which itself invites, for although the schoolmaster
uses the words in two other places, in neither case are they
at the beginning of a chapter.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> It should be added that in this the
worthy historian of Hertfordshire only followed the lead of both
Bale and Pits.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. On sig. <span class='blackletter'>a j</span> recto of “Cote Armour” is “Insomuch as all gentleness comes of God;”
and upon sig. <span class='blackletter'>b iij</span> verso is “Insomuch that in the fifth quadrat,” &#38;c. The use of the word
in these cases could have no veiled meaning, and it was probably only a peculiarity of
diction which had become a habit with the schoolmaster.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Was he connected with the Abbey? I think not. There is not
a word to suggest such a connection, although we may take it for
granted that the Abbot and his fraternity could not have frowned upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the printer, or he would never have established himself. His imprints
all mention the town of St. Albans, but never the Abbey, and his position
was probably similar to that of Caxton, who was simply a tenant
of the Abbot of Westminster, but, so far as is known, nothing more.</p>

<p class='c008'>Was he connected with Caxton and the Westminster press? Without
a shadow of doubt I say, No! Mr. E. Scott, of the MS. department
in the British Museum, has indeed strung together a number
of surmises to show that the Schoolmaster was employed by Caxton,
and that all the books without date or place hitherto attributed to
Westminster were really printed at St. Albans. But internal evidence
is against any such gratuitous assumption. There is nothing in common
between the two printers in any of their habits or customs except the
possession of Caxton’s No. 3 type. This is the only one of Caxton’s
types used outside his own office (for W. de Worde, his successor
in house and business, must not be regarded as a separate printer).
Caxton employed it from his arrival in England in 1477 till 1484,
when it makes its last appearance in the headings of “Æsop,” the
“Order of Chivalry,” and “The Golden Legend.” In 1485 Caxton
obtained a new fount, similar in shape and character, and from that
time the old No. 3 disappears to make way for the new and smaller
type No. 5. This being more suited to the taste of the day, we
find the larger and worn fount passing over to the country press of
St. Albans, where the Schoolmaster first uses it in 1486, being the
identical year in which its successor appears in Caxton’s “Royal
Book.” We may here observe that after the stoppage of the St.
Albans’ Press the same fount finds its way back again and is seen
in W. de Worde’s reprint, in 1496–97, of the two English St. Albans
books. But the discovery of a copy of Caxton’s Boethius in the
old Grammar School at St. Albans, and the numerous fragments of
old books extracted from its covers, are quoted as confirming the idea.
Yet the book itself and all these fragments were from Westminster,
not a single one being from a known St. Albans book, and they
included the Caxton “Chronicles,” 1480, the “Dictes,” 1477, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>still earlier “Life of Jason;” so that we had better at once remove the
whole Westminster press, dated and undated, to St. Albans, if such an
argument is to have any force. These fragments, indeed, can only
point to the fact that the copy of Boethius was bound in the printing
office, as was commonly the case with the books from Caxton’s press.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, Mr. Scott draws attention to the fact that a page of the
St. Albans’ Book, 1486, has been copied by a contemporary writer
on to the blank leaves of one of Caxton’s earliest books. ’Tis true;
but this copying of part of one book into another, printed ten years
before, has no typographical bearing whatever. Lastly, the name
Causton appears in an old St. Albans’ Register of the early part of the
fifteenth century. But this, again, means positively nothing. Caxton’s
name was not at all uncommon; there were Caustons or Caxtons in
nearly every English county, and I have quite a long list of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is highly probable that Caxton, while at Westminster, in the
van of all the literature of his day, would have communications
of some sort with the important town of St. Albans; but that the
two printers assisted one another in the production of books, is, so far
as any evidence goes, a pure fiction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us now glance at the bibliographical aspect of the book.</p>

<p class='c008'>The work itself has no title. It is difficult in our time, accustomed
as we are to “teeming millions” of books, each with its own title-page,
to conceive a period when the press sent out works without
even the shadow of a title-page. Before the invention of printing,
the author simply headed his first page with the name of the work,
as “Here begins the Confessio Amantis,” or “Hic incipit Parvus
Catho,” and, without preface or more ado, the text commenced.
Sometimes even this little notification was omitted, and, as in
Caxton’s “Jason,” “The Chess Book,” “Tulle,” and many other
fifteenth-century books, the subject of the work had to be learned
by reading the text. So it is with the book now under review;
it comprises four distinct works, but to one only is there any
heading, and that has the bare line “Incipit liber armorum.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The first, “The Book of Hawking,” starts straight off—“This is
the manner to keep Hawks,” and occupies three signatures, <span class='blackletter'>a</span>, <span class='blackletter'>b</span>,
and <span class='blackletter'>c</span>, of eight leaves each, and sig. <span class='blackletter'>d</span>, which has but four leaves,
on purpose that this portion might be complete alone, if so desired.
The same idea controlled the arrangement of “The Book of
Hunting,” which, beginning on sig. <span class='blackletter'>e j</span>, ends with Dame Juliana’s
“Explicit” on the recto of sig. <span class='blackletter'>f iiij</span>. This left the last seven pages
of the quaternion to be filled up. Now it was a common practice,
both with the scribes and with the early printers, when they got
to the end of their text and found that a page or two of blank
paper was left, to occupy the blank pages with such common
household aphorisms or popular rhymes as came easily to the memory,
or were at hand in some other book. So here the schoolmaster-printer
fills up his vacant pages with a number of odd sentences and
rhymes, most of which occur over and over again in numerous manuscripts
of early poetry. Among others we notice the well-known:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Arise erly,</div>
      <div class='line'>serue God deuouteli,</div>
      <div class='line'>and the world besily.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>&#38;c.        &#38;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Also the folks proverb:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Too wyues in oon hous,</div>
      <div class='line'>Too cattys and oon mous,</div>
      <div class='line'>Too dogges and oon boon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Theis shall neū accorde oon.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Then the list of proper terms to be used by gentlemen and those
curious in their speech is of very common occurrence:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“An herde of Hertis</div>
      <div class='line'>An herde of all mañ dere</div>
      <div class='line'>A pride of Lionys</div>
      <div class='line'>A sleuth of Beeris.”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>&#38;c.        &#38;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This was evidently copied from some MS., and ends with “¶ Explicit,”
and nothing more. On the next page we have the proper
terms for carving or dismembering beasts, fowls, and fishes, followed
on the last leaf by a list of bishoprics and provinces.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Having thus filled up all his leaves, the printer begins his third
subject on a fresh signature, and introduces the “Liber Armorum”
with the Preface (already printed). A long work on the “Blasing
of Arms” follows, beginning on sig. <span class='blackletter'>c j</span>, and ending on sig. <span class='blackletter'>f</span> 10.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is extremely interesting, both in matter and in the very
rude woodcut representations of armorial bearings with which the
text is profusely illustrated. Except in one or two cases of uncommon
tints, these are all colour-printed, as are the initials to paragraphs.
In the Grenville copy, the pressman having forgotten to roll the
“forme,” the initials all appear in that semi-tinted state which
would be the natural result of such an omission. We notice, too,
that where the coats of arms require, say, three colours on one page,
then the initials are also in three colours; but if only one colour
is required for the arms, only one colour, and that the same, is used
for the initials. Occasionally, where a peculiar colour was necessary,
a brush was used to insert that tint by hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>In workmanship the St. Albans printer, especially in the English
books, is much inferior to the contemporary issue from the Westminster
press. The types are worse, the arrangement worse, the
presswork worse, and the ink worse. From this point of view alone,
the theory that he would print for Caxton so much better than he
did for himself, is not worth serious consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Book of St. Albans went through many editions, particulars
of which are difficult to obtain.</p>

<p class='c008'>How did the schoolmaster at St. Albans obtain his types? This
is a puzzling question in the present state of palæotypography. Mr.
Bradshaw of Cambridge has, by unwearied study of early printed
books, thrown great light upon the connection and genealogy of
numerous founts used by fifteenth-century printers, and systematic
attention to the minute peculiarities of each printer is doubtless the
only way in which those old books can be forced to yield up their
secrets; but the task is immense, and beyond the powers of any one
man to complete. Some day, however, when the palæotypography
of this country, as well as of the Continental presses, shall have
received that full technical and philosophical analysis which time
is sure to bring, the more fortunate bibliographer of the future
will be able with certainty to track the footsteps and operations of
the early typefounders, and will be enabled to state for certain to
what extent Caxton and the St. Albans printer were their own
typefounders, and to what extent and to whom they looked for
outside help. As the case now stands, we can only confess our
ignorance of where the St. Albans types came from.</p>

In the rude civilisation of the fifteenth century, a year’s
experience of which would send most of us to our
graves, the mental occupation as well as the bodily
recreation of our ancestors was almost confined to
hunting and hawking. “Fishing with an Angle”
came in as a bad third, being too tame a pursuit for men who were
no men if not men of war. Mimic war—war on the beasts of the
field and the fowls of the air—war which could be pursued in times
of peace, and which yet required knowledge, patience, fortitude, and
courage—this had great attractions, and we cannot wonder at the
general popularity of these pursuits.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first treatise in the following reprint is upon Hawking, a
pastime essentially aristocratic from the great expense it entailed in
the purchase, breeding, and maintenance of the birds. This, indeed,
coupled with the diminution of game consequent on the progress of
civilisation and the increase of the population, led to the gradual
decadence of the sport, and nearly to its extinction in the eighteenth
century, although, in very rare cases, falconry is even now practised.</p>

<p class='c008'>As we have seen, one of the most difficult objects in hawking
was to obtain an easy command of the proper vocabulary, and so at
first start our author instructs us in “The manner to speak of Hawks,
from the egg.” We must not say a young hawk is hatched, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>‘disclosed;’ they do not breed but “eyer;” it was a want of culture
in any falconer to say that hawks were building their nest, they
“timbered” it. When the young could first leave the nest they were
“Bowesses,” and when they could fly they were “Branchers,” and
then was the time to catch and train them.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the young were caught, which was with nets, the first thing
was to “ensile” them, that is, to “take a needle and thread and
sew up the eyelids,” so that they “see never a dele.” After a night
and a day the threads were cut softly for fear of breaking the “lyddis
of the ighen,” then they were fed with well-washed flesh, but kept
awake the next night and day, after which they were supposed to
be tame, or “reclaimed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The various diseases to which Hawks are liable are then explained,
and medicines prescribed for them. Some of these are very absurd
and some contradictory. Then comes a variety of terms for every
movement and habit, for every limb or part of the body, and for
almost every feather in the plumage. In this minute description the
author begins at the feet of the bird and so works upwards, as when
“Knyghttis been harnesside.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Next we are instructed how important it is to be careful of the
manner of guiding the Hawk the first time it is ready to “nomme
a partridge;” how to reward her by giving her the head and neck, after
which on no account is she to fly again till she has “rejoiced,” <i>i.e.</i>,
sharpened her beak and shaken her feathers. More medicines follow,
among which is how to get rid of “lies” (lice). “Take a piece of
rough blanket and hold it to the fire till it is quite hot; wrap the
hawk therein, and without hurting hold her ‘softely and stylly’ in your
hands, and all the vermin will creep into the cloth.” A happy thought
this!</p>

<p class='c008'>The “Gesse,” or strip of leather by which the Hawk is held when
carrying her on the hand, is next described, together with the creance
or long line. More medicines still, and then how to treat Hawks when
“in mew,” or moulting, a matter of great importance. To promote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“mewing” give the flesh of a kid, a young swan, and especially rats
flesh; stewed adders are also strongly recommended, or chickens which
have been fed upon wheat soaked in broth of vipers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gout seems a common disease in various parts of the Hawk’s body,
which may be known by swelling and “ungladness;” also rheum and
fever and blains and agrum, which last is cured by a red-hot silver
needle thrust into the nostrils. Botches in the jaw should be “kutte
with a knyfe.” More terms follow for various habits and actions, the
last paragraph being upon the variety of Bells used for Hawks. There
should be two, one a “semytoyn” (semitone) below the other. “The
Bells of Melen (Milan?) were the best, but,” says the author, “there
be now used Dutchland bells, of a town called durdright (Dordrecht),
and they be passing good, sonowre (sonorous) of ringing in shrillness,
and well lasting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole ends with a list of various species of Hawks and their
appropriateness to the various stations of life, among which are—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>An Eagle for an Emperor.</div>
      <div class='line'>A Gerfalcon for a King.</div>
      <div class='line'>A Peregrine for an Earl.</div>
      <div class='line'>A Merlyon for a Lady.</div>
      <div class='line'>A Goshawk for a Yeoman.</div>
      <div class='line'>A Sparehawk for a Priest.</div>
      <div class='line'>A Muskyte for “an holiwater clerke.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The second treatise is upon Hunting, and has a short preface, which
probably came, like the first, from the pen of the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p class='c008'>The work is all in metre, and evidently intended for boys to learn
by heart. It begins by telling “my dere chylde” the various kinds
of beast to be hunted; the changes of name they take as they grow
older; the variety of horns; how to skin and dismember; the various
cries and noises to be used; the seasons of hunting various beasts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then follow instructions how to hunt the Hare, and what to say
to the hounds, who must always be addressed in French, as “arere!”
when he enters the kennel-door; “this is the first word, my son, of
venery.” “Sa sa cy auaunt,” “Sweff mon amy sweff,” and other similar
cries are noted down, some to be shouted twice only and some thrice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the chief cry being “So how.” The knowledge of when and how often
these cries should be used was most important, as their proper use would
bring “worship among all men.” Here, apparently, in the midst of
one essay, another is interpolated, and we are treated to a portion of
some old dialogue like “The Master of the Hunt,” in which the
“Man” asks all sorts of questions and the “Master” replies. It might
indeed be dubbed “The Hunter’s Catechism.” This occupies eight
pages, and then we fall back upon the original rhyme again and the
instructions of the Dame to “my childe,” ending with the “Explicit”
of Dam Julyans Barnes. Some leaves remaining to be filled up, the
moral and other sentences, as already described at page 21, were added.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps the third treatise upon Coat Armour and the Blason of
Arms is the most interesting portion of the book. The quaintness of
some of the explanations is very amusing, and many people will
find more points of sympathy, both historical and technical, with this
than with the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>The headline, “Incipit Liber Armorum,” gives us at once the
title of the manuscript from which the text was compiled. “Heraldry
Run Mad” might indeed have been an appropriate title for this, as
well as all similar tractates; for the author, in his anxiety to honour
the science, does not scruple to take the reader back historically not to
Noah only, but to Adam, whose spade, he tells us, was the first shield
in Heraldry, and who was the first to bear Coat Armour. The argument,
if it may so be called, is:—All “gentilnes” comes from God;
there were originally in heaven ten Orders of Angels bearing Coat
Armour, but now only nine, Lucifer with “mylionys of aungelis”
having fallen out of heaven into hell and other places. As a bondman
might say that all men come from Adam, so might Lucifer say he
and his angels came from heaven.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cain, for his wickedness, was the first churl, and all his offspring
were churls also by the curse of God. Seth, on the other hand, was
a gentleman by his father’s blessing; Noah, too, was a gentleman by
nature, but of his three sons, “Sem, Cham, and Jafeth,” Cham, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>his unfilial conduct, was made “ungentle.” The address of Noah to
his three sons is curious, and is thus supplemented:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of the offspring of the gentleman Japhet came Abraham, Moses
Aaron, and the prophets, and also the King of the right line of Mary,
of whom that gentleman Jesus was born, very God and man, after his
manhood King of the land of Judah and of Jews, a gentleman by his
mother Mary, and Prince of Coat Armour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Some say that Coat Armour began at the siege of Troy, but it
was of far greater antiquity than that, and was founded upon the nine
Orders of Angels, who were crowned each with a diadem of precious
stones—the Topaz (truth), Smaragdus (hardihood), Amethyst (chivalry),
Loys (powerful), Ruby (courageous), Sapphire (wisdom), Diamond, a
black stone (durable), Carbuncle (doughty and glorious). These
represent Gentleman, Squire, Knight, Baron, Lord, Earl, Marquis,
Duke, and Prince. Here we probably have the origin of the shape
of various crowns and coronets. Everything is treated in nines, and
the nine virtues and nine vices of gentleness follow, with nine rejoicings,
nine articles that every knight should keep, and nine manner of
gentlemen, in which we learn that the Evangelists and Apostles were
all gentlemen of the right line of that worthy conqueror, Judas
Machabeus, who in course of time had fallen to labour, and so were
not called gentlemen. The four doctors of the Church—St. Jerome
Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregory—were also gentlemen of blood and
of Coat Armour. There are nine differences of Coat Armour and nine
quadrats, all of which are explained. The “Blasyng of Arms” comes
next, the preface to which is by the author, and not by the printer.
It begins with the varieties of the Cross as borne in arms, each being
illustrated by a rude woodcut printed in its proper colours, and the
blason, or technical description of each is given in Latin, French,
and English. All varieties of arms follow, with the mysteries of
bends, engrail, borders, chequers, balls, cakes, rings, &#38;c., offering
but little which can be quoted, but forming an interesting and useful
book of reference.</p>

There is a strongly marked individuality in the spelling
throughout all the treatises in this work. If the
Hunting rhymes belong to Dam Julyans, their orthography,
like the prose portions, is that of the Schoolmaster,
who appears to have been a North-countryman,
many words leading to that conclusion. The formation of the plural
by adding the letters “is” or “ys” strikes the attention at once. Thus
the plural of bells is bellis; egg, eggis; vetch, fetchis; fulmert, fulmertis;
hawk, hawkys; herd, herdys; person, personys, and so on.
The change of a <i>y</i> at the end of a word to an <i>i</i> is common, as onli,
softeli, unthrefti; and for if; algate; awth for all the; bowke; chylder;
clepit; clees; knaw; ken; yowre; and many others are Northern. As
might be expected, many Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman words now
obsolete are found, such as benymme, blynne, byzete, canell, clepit,
colver, dagon, gobbit, kawe, kydde, liggen, merde, nasethrils, nym,<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
raton, and many others.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have now traced the various aspects in which this curious work
may be viewed. There is not one of them that would not repay
much deeper study, and the reader will, doubtless, sympathise with
the writer in the wish that more could be discovered concerning the
schoolmaster-printer. That his pioneer attempts to establish a printing
press met with many discouragements was a matter of course; and,
doubtless, he had many technical, business, and even social difficulties
to overcome; for a reading public had to be created and patronage
was scantily afforded. Nevertheless he struggled on for at least seven
years, as we learn from the dates on his books, and whatever may have
been his shortcomings, either as author or as printer, the fact of his having
been one of the earliest promoters in this country of the grandest
discovery which the mind of man has yet made, will unite all of us
in honouring the memory and respecting the name, shadowy though it
be, of the “Scole mayster of St. Albon.”</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
